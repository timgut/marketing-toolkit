2137,6,"Register For Our Opioid Training Now! ","The objective of the training is for workers to recognize the dangers of opioid related substances. The training will include best practices to avoid exposure and the employers’ responsibility under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Personal Protective Equipment Standard (29 CFR 1910.132) to issue gloves, safety glasses and masks to workers who may be involved in securing, handling or cleaning up illicit drugs. Workers will also be taught best practices for handling and disposing of used hypodermic needles and the employers’ responsibilities under OSHA’s Bloodborne Pathogen Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030). Workers will also be informed of the signs and symptoms of a drug overdose and the emergency steps that should be considered in responding to the situation.  

Workers will learn about the life saving drug Naloxone (Narcan) and will be trained in how to administer the auto-injection and nasal forms of the medication. Students who successfully complete this course will receive a certificate for Adult First Aid/CPR & AED and an additional certificate in Opioid Rescue Techniques from AFSCME which is valid for two years.

•Have you submitted your open window yet? Better get it in soon before it disappears. The County is proposing complete elimination and eradication of open window process. 

•Bereavement time should be respected! No cuts to bereavement time!

•Does your wrist hurt? Does your neck ache? Have you lost your 20/20 vision? Stop stalling, stop putting it off because this time next year your worker’s comp benefits may not exist. 

WILL YOU ALLOW THIS HAPPEN?

These are some of the issues we’re fighting for: 

•We want the same rights that are part of the “SSA Cares” campaign to apply to workers. Integrity, Fairness, Compassion, Dignity, Respect, Courtesy….etc

•We want rational, measurable, achievable criteria for workers during performance evaluations

•Give probationary employees criteria they must meet to pass probation

•Give workers paid time off to seek treatment for workers comp. injuries

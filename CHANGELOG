Run "date" locally to get the timestamp.

The timestamp should reflect when either a) the code was deployed into production; or b) when master was updated, in case of non-deploys.

Latest changes go on top.

	- Finally cleaned up the whole "tk-rev" crap on the server.
	- The prod branch had been "edge". It's back to being master in the proper directory on chi-afscme
	- Did this at the same time as the 5.7 MySQL upgrade.
	- Also, I added the admin mailer fixes that were done last week into this canonical production branch (they had been in master, but that was not the prod branch, edge was)
	- In short, everything is standardized once again.
